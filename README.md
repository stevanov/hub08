# hub08

#### WiseLords HUB08 Library Ported for easier use with Arduino IDE (WIP)

For use with cheap Chinese hub08 matrix panels 

I can find very little information about the hub08 definition so if anybody has a protocol description please drop me a line!

Seems to be more confusion on this: https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=188870.0

Eventually i found WiseLords lib and i'll just use that for lack of documentation.

This is the best info I have been able to find:
